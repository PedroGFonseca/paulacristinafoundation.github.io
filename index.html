                    <p><strong>Foundation Objectives:</strong> The Foundation supports access to pre-primary, primary, secondary, technical and higher education, with a particular focus on girls. We operate primarily in Kenya and may expand to other countries as partnerships develop. We also provide health services, hygiene support, safe housing, and other essential services that enable students to access education.</p>
                    <p><strong>Main Activities:</strong> Multi-year scholarships covering educational expenses (fees, materials, transport, boarding); health and hygiene support (sanitary products, vaccinations, reproductive health education); basic necessities for educational access (food, housing, medical insurance); support for local implementing partners; and emergency relief to ensure educational continuity during crises.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fundraising & Asset Management:</strong> Funds are raised through donations and grants. At least 90% of our activities serve public benefit. The Foundation is non-profit. In case of dissolution, assets will be directed to a similar educational ANBI organization.</p>
