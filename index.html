                    <h3>Objectives & Policy Highlights</h3>
                    <p><strong>Foundation Objectives:</strong> The Foundation supports, funds, and facilitates access to pre-primary, primary, secondary, technical and higher education, with a particular – but not exclusive – focus on girls. Activities include but are not limited to educational institutions in Kenya, and may be carried out in any country worldwide. The Foundation may provide assistance with basic needs, health services, hygiene, safe housing, food security, and other welfare measures, to the extent that such assistance enhances or enables access to education.</p>
                    <p><strong>Public Benefit:</strong> At least 90% of the Foundation's activities serve public benefit purposes. The Foundation operates exclusively for charitable and educational objectives as defined in Dutch tax law.</p>
                    <p><strong>Main Activities:</strong> The Foundation accomplishes its objectives by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fundraising and efficient use of funds</li>
                        <li>Providing financial or in-kind support for educational expenses (school fees, materials, transport, boarding, scholarships)</li>
                        <li>Funding hygiene products and health services (sanitary pads, vaccinations, reproductive health education)</li>
                        <li>Providing basic necessities necessary for educational access (food, safe housing, medical insurance, hearing aids, glasses)</li>
                        <li>Covering expenses incurred by local partners in carrying out the Foundation's objectives</li>
                        <li>Supporting temporary emergency relief measures that ensure educational continuity (temporary boarding, flood relief, provision of water or food during crises)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Asset Management & Dissolution:</strong> The Foundation is non-profit and does not seek to generate profits. Funds are raised through donations and grants, and are managed efficiently to maximize educational impact. In case of dissolution, all remaining assets will be directed to a similar ANBI-recognized educational organization with comparable objectives.</p>

                    <h3>Activities Report</h3>
                    <p>As a newly incorporated foundation (2025), initial programs will commence in 2026 following the establishment of partnerships with schools and local implementing organizations in Kenya. The Foundation is currently in the preparatory phase, developing operational frameworks, vetting partner schools, and establishing criteria for scholarship recipients.</p>
                    <p>Once operational, the Foundation will provide multi-year scholarships to female students, prioritizing those who would otherwise be unable to complete their education. Detailed activities reports and impact metrics will be published annually starting with the first full year of operations.</p>

                <div class="anbi-block">
                    <h3>Financial Information</h3>
                    <p>The Foundation maintains transparent financial records in accordance with Dutch accounting standards. Annual financial statements, including balance sheets, income and expenditure statements, and explanatory notes, will be published on this website within 6 months of each fiscal year end, as required by Dutch ANBI regulations.</p>
                    <p>Financial reports will include detailed breakdowns of income sources, program expenditures, administrative costs, and fund allocations, ensuring full transparency for donors, beneficiaries, and regulatory authorities.</p>
